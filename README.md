#Explaination the Project
RideHailDataGen is a real-time data simulation and analytics pipeline designed to mimic the operational flow of ride-hailing platforms like Uber, Lyft, and Cabify. These platforms rely on continuous event streams to match drivers and passengers, monitor rides, and optimize pricing in real time. The project replicates this scenario by generating realistic ride-hailing events, ingesting them through a message broker, storing them in cloud infrastructure, and analyzing them via streaming tools to extract actionable insights.

##Objective
The main objective is to simulate a real-world, high-throughput ride-hailing ecosystem and process its streaming data using modern cloud-based technologies. The output is an end-to-end pipeline capable of powering real-time dashboards and insights for operational and strategic decision-making.

Goals for Data Generation: Simulate events such as ride requests, cancellations, driver availability, ride statuses, and pricing changes using Python. Outputs are serialized in both JSON and AVRO formats.
Goals for Event Ingestion: Use Azure EventHub to handle high-throughput ingestion and transport of event streams into the processing layer.

##Why It Matters
This simulation helps model and understand:
• How ride-hailing services rely on data infrastructure.
• The role of real-time analytics in service reliability and efficiency.
• How scalable architectures enable decision-making on the fly.
